SHCol stands for **SHell COLors**

It is Python (and PHP in future versions)  library providing strings representing ANSI escape codes for coloring output for most modern terminals.

Color escape codes are from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) (Description>Colors>3-bit and 4-bit)
